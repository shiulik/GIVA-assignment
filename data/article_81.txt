The death of Queen Elizabeth II leads every national newspaper in the U.K. on Friday morning.
The queen, who was the U.K.‚Äôs longest-serving monarch, is being remembered for her steadfast commitment to her role and her lifetime dedication to the crown.
Here‚Äôs a look at those historic front pages.
The Times is one of the outlets which uses a famous photo by Cecil Beaton that marked the monarch‚Äôs coronation back in 1953 ‚Äî aged 27 ‚Äî to honor her passing, alongside a caption: ‚ÄúA life in service.‚Äù

The Daily Star uses the same image, with the headline: ‚Äù‚ÄòYou did your duty, ma‚Äôam.‚Äô‚Äù

The Independent and The Guardian splash with that famous photo too, although neither paper includes a quote, simply the date of the queen‚Äôs birth and death ‚Äî 1926 to 2022.

The i also goes for the same photograph, but has a more informative front page with a breakdown of the four key details from the day. It explains that the monarch died in Balmoral in the afternoon, and that the country is likely to enter 10 days of mourning. The queen‚Äôs successor, King Charles III, will be making an address on Friday too.

The Daily Mail opts for an image of the queen from 1952, when she was still Princess Elizabeth, first in line to the throne. She‚Äôs pictured without the crown jewels, but with a smaller crown and ornate decorative jewellery. Its front page carries a quote from its columnist Sarah Vine: ‚ÄúOur hearts are broken.‚Äù
Our hearts are broken: It just seems unimaginable. That wisest and most steadfast of women, our guiding light in the darkest of nights, has gone.https://t.co/A6XLugMvCv pic.twitter.com/EmSjFuB8cC
The Metro‚Äôs front page includes another photo from the same occasion, except in this one the queen is slightly smiling while looking over her shoulder. It carries the dates of her life, 1926 to 2022.

The Financial Times used a more candid image than its competitors, opting for a photo of the queen in her finery while leaning out of a carriage, smiling, with her full title in its headline ‚Äî ‚ÄúQueen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022.‚Äù

The Sun uses a more modern, but still formal, portrait of the queen for its front page, displayed in black and white, with a purple masthead, while choosing another image of the late monarch in her youth for its back page. On the front, it goes with the headline: ‚ÄúWe loved you Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù
Below, it has a caption remembering her as Britain‚Äôs longest-serving monarch, and concluding: ‚ÄúWe are proud you were our Queen.‚Äù

The Daily Record chooses an image of the monarch in profile, in her finery during a special occasion, while smiling. It foregoes a headline altogether, just writing: ‚ÄúQueen Elizabeth II: 1926 - 2022.‚Äù

The Mirror also uses an image of the queen in profile, but this time she has a more somber expression. This picture is just accompanied by the headline: ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

The Daily Telegraph opts for the same black and white image of the queen that the royal family released to announce her death.
The paper attaches a quote from a speech the monarch shared when sending her condolences to the U.S. over 9/11: ‚ÄùGrief is the price we pay for love.‚Äù

Regional newspapers across the country also acknowledged the historic occasion too, although some used less formal images to mark her death. 
Scottish newspaper The Herald, however, did choose a formal image showing the queen in her finery while standing in the Highlands.

The New York Times, the New Yorker and TIME magazine all gave their front pages to the queen.
